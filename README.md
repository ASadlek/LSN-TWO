# Implementation for 2nd LSN Backend Task

## Goal
Again, the input is a long list of integers. Provide a working code that will find all the pairs (in this integer list) that sum up to 13. Each pair in the output should have first number not greater than the second one and lines should be sorted in an ascending order.

## Prerequisites
To use this application, you need to have JDK (Java 8+) and Maven installed on your computer.

## Instructions
Follow these commands to run the application for the first time:

```bash
mvn compile
mvn exec:java
```
If the application was compiled at least once, you can run it with just:

```bash
mvn exec:java
```
You should see this message after starting the application:

```
Enter numbers separated by spaces or type 'exit' to quit:
```

Only integer values are allowed as input. (from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).

You can try by providing sample input from https://backend-tasks.lsn.io/
